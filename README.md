# Plant Disease Detection

This project aims to detect plant diseases using a deep learning model trained on image data. It leverages Python and machine learning techniques to classify various plant diseases with high accuracy.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `chal.py`: Main Python script for loading the model and making predictions.
- `Train_plant_diseases.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook used for training and evaluating the model.

## 🚀 Features

- Image-based disease classification.
- Trained with Keras/TensorFlow on a labeled plant disease dataset.
- Easily extendable to new classes or datasets.

## 🛠 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Jupyter Notebook

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
